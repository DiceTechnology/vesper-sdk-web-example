# React Sample App

This application demonstrates a sample integration of the Vesper SDK with React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project--next to the existing `.env` file.

You'll need to create and populate the following environment variables:
- `REACT_APP_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `REACT_APP_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- `REACT_APP_API_KEY`

You may also change the values defined in the `.env` file if you wish to target another content (for example).

To run the project use: `npm start` at the root of the monorepo.
